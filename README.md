Optimized Entity Linking Through Wikipedia
========

## Overview
We provide a simple interface for Named-Entity Linking and "wikification" of a passage of text using a variant of local search and the Wikipedia API as specified in our research paper 
[Search Optimizations in Named Entity Linking Systems](http://example.net/). 

Given a passage of text, such as "China has a large population", our system will link every keyword in that passage to its corresponding wikipedia page with a high confidence score through the modification of alpha, a parameter that can be specified at runtime.
